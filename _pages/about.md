I am an assistant professor (senior lecturer) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/), and a research scientist at [The Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org/). I develop artificial intelligence methods that **augment and scale scientific knowledge discovery** by harnessing vast repositories of scientific knowledge (e.g., literature, knowledge bases, electronic medical records). My goal is to build systems that transform the scientific process, by helping humans to explore useful literature, discover new directions and solutions to problems, generate research hypotheses, and make well-informed decisions. See more about my research [here](research).

My work has received four best paper awards, appeared in top venues (e.g., NAACL, EMNLP, ACL, CHI, AAAI, WSDM, KDD, CACM, PNAS), and received coverage from Nature and Science.  I was a postdoctoral researcher at AI2 and the University of Washington (UW), working with [Daniel Weld](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld) and [Eric Horvitz](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/horvitz/). Before that, I did my PhD with [Dafna Shahaf](http://www.hyadatalab.com/), and in parallel led an applied AI research [team at Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/bios/tom-hope.html) that published award-winning work. I was awarded the 2022 [Azrieli Early Career Faculty Fellowship](https://azrielifoundation.org/fellows/earlycareer/) which is given to eight scientists across all fields of study, selected to participate in the 2021 [Global Young Scientists Summit](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/gyss/home) and 2019 [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/about-us.html) and was a member of the KDD 2020 Best Paper Selection Committee.
