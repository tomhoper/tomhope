I am an incoming assistant professor (senior lecturer) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/), and a research scientist at [The Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org/). I create AI models and systems to **augment and scale scientific knowledge discovery**. I was a postdoctoral researcher at AI2 and the University of Washington (UW), working with [Daniel Weld](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld) and [Eric Horvitz](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/horvitz/). My work has received four best paper awards, appeared in top venues (e.g., KDD, WSDM, AAAI, NAACL, EMNLP, ACL, CHI), and received coverage from Nature and Science. I also led an applied AI research team at Intel that published award-winning work. I was selected to participate in the 2021 [Global Young Scientists Summit](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/gyss/home) and 2019 [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/about-us.html) and was a member of the KDD 2020 Best Paper Selection Committee.


<h1 class="page__title" itemprop="headline">My Work</h1>

We are at a unique point in the history of science, where essentially all of scientific knowledge is in the digital space. This presents huge opportunity for computational approaches that augment and accelerate innovation by harnessing humankindâ€™s collective knowledge. I develop artificial intelligence (AI) methods to harness vast repositories of scientific knowledge (e.g., literature, knowledge bases, electronic medical records) for helping humans to discover new knowledge.

 Progress in research relies on leveraging _existing_ knowledge for creating _new_ knowledge. Similarly, practitioners in fields like medicine and engineering are often required to make complex decisions rooted in deep scientific knowledge. But with an explosion of scholarly information produced every day, experts often cannot see the broad landscape of possibility.  My goal is to build systems that help humans throughout all stages of scientific work: discovering useful literature, exploring new directions and solutions to problems, generating hypotheses, and maing well-informed decisions. 

<!-- My work has been [published](publications) My [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily
focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develop new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both international relations and quantitative methodology, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
