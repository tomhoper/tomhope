We are at a unique point in the history of science, where essentially all of scientific knowledge is in the digital space. This presents huge opportunity for computational approaches that augment and accelerate innovation by harnessing humankindâ€™s collective knowledge. Progress in research relies on leveraging _existing_ knowledge for creating _new_ knowledge. Similarly, practitioners in fields like medicine and engineering are often required to make complex decisions rooted in deep scientific knowledge. But** with an explosion of scholarly information produced every day, experts often cannot see the broad landscape of possibility**. My goal is to build new AI models and systems that **mine scholarly literature, scientific knowledge bases and medical records** to help researchers and science-driven practitioners throughout all stages of their work: coming up with ideas, generating hypotheses, finding solutions to problems, performing analyses and making decisions. 

My work spans a ``full-stack'' spectrum --- from constructing new datasets, tasks and machine learning models, to designing user experiments and user-facing systems. In order to be able to work with scientific knowledge, my work explores new paradigms in diverse areas of computer science such as text mining, search and retrieval, information extraction, human-computer interation, weak supervision, complex network visualization, knowledge graph construction and link prediction. Below is a sample of some representative projects.
